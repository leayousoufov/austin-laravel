						<aside class="notes">
						Started as 'Personal Home Page'</br>
						3: Was for an ecommerce school project - they wanted PHP to support what they needed it for</br>
						4: Became Hypertext Preprocessor</br>
						6: Lack of Unicode support initiated PHP 6 but a lack of developers caused it to fall flat</br>
						7: The PHP we know and love today

						<aside class="notes">
							Laravel 1 came out later that month </br>
							Lack of controllers prevented it from truly being MVC </br>
							2: Became a true MVC framework </br>
							3: Included CLI we know as Artisan </br>
							4: Included a complete rewrite of Laravel </br>

						<h1>Cons</h1>
						<h5 class="fragment">*Mostly grievences with PHP</h5>
					</section>
					<section id="fragments">
						<h2>Let's Compare</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Python - 1989</li>
							<li class="fragment">Ruby - 1995</li>
							<li class="fragment">PHP was out for 9 years before it supported object-oriented programming</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							Python: Was an object-oriented porgraming language from the very beginning </br>
							Ruby: Was an object-oriented programming language from the very beginning </br>
							It took PHP 9 years to get join the race of object-oriented programming</br>
							It was finally able to meet the demand of its users

						<h2>Backwards Compatibility</h2>
						<h5>As we scaled, legacy code was a stubborn shrew</h5>

						<aside class="notes">

						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Hiring</h2>
						<h5>It's difficult to hire good developers to tackle a legacy code base in PHP</h5>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>More...</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Not backwards compatible</li> <!-- Between Laravel version and PHP versions-->
							<li>Large learning curve</li>
							<li>How well do you know PHP?</li> <!-- Because Laravel strips out a lot of the weirdness in PHP -->
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							Backwards: Laravel 5.5 only supports PHP 7 </br>
							Learning curve: Easy to get started but what about Facades & wtf is an IoC Container? </br>
							Laravel is magic - which is great until something breaks and you have no idea what's going on because everything is obfuscated</br>
							For example - what's a facade? what's a service container?</br>
							Laravel strips out a lot of the weirdness of PHP - are you a PHP dev or a Laravel dev?
						</aside>

						<h2>PHP is Weird</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							While this is a con, it's also a pro - you don't have to worry about all the flaws of the language

						<h2>Let's See How it Stacks Up Against the Rest</h2>
						<img src="images/laravel-v-others.png" style="width: 50%; height: 50%">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>More...</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Laravel is constantly growing and releasing new features</li>
							<li>Facades & Service Containers</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							The difference between 5.3 and 5.5 is one year - that's pretty crazy for 3 versions</br>
							Facades are a static interface for integrating classes with Laravel
							Instead of instatinating a class, passing in the dependencies, etc.
							You use a facade and laravel takes care of the whole process for you behind the scenes.</br>
							But Jeffrey Way can describe this stuff a lot better than I can - laracasts</br>

						<h2>How We Use Laravel</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>It runs our main site</li>
							<li>Our CMS</li>
							<li>Our billing API</li>
							<li>Our faculty portal</li>
							<li>And it will continue to be implemented into more projects as the company grows</li>

						<h2>Facing Your Demons</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Upgrade from 4.2 to 5.3</li>
							<li>Implementing API authentication</li>
							<li>Implementing social logins</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							Again, Laravel isn't backwards compatible so the upgrade was a disaster. Almost everything broke</br>
							Authentication without Laravel & everything it provides would have been a nightmare - a secondary package would have been required
							and what are the chances that something like that gets maintained properly?</br>
							Social logins would also require a package and would get unbelievably messy and untameable.</br>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Tending to Your Demons</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Laravel's extensive documentation</li>
							<li>The community</li>
							<li>Laravel Passport & Auth facade</li>
							<li>Laravel Socialite</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							The extensive documentation carefully traced all the steps necessary for the upgrade</br>
							Whatever the documentation lacked - the community helped with - your question has already been answered</br>
							For authentication - Laravel offers two amazing packages (Passport & Socialite)</br>
							Passport - provides a full OAuth2 server implementation for API authentication (announced in 2016 at Laracon)</br>
							Socialite - fluent interface to OAuth authentication with FB, G+, Twitter, more </br>
							Whenever the FB API changes - Socialite changes with you, we no longer have to worry about our social logins breaking with every update.
