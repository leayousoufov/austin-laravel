						<h2>Hiring</h2>

						<h2>Scaling</h2>
						<h5>As we scaled, legacy code was a stubborn shrew</h5>

						<h2>More...</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Not backwards compatible</li> <!-- Between Laravel version and PHP versions-->
							<li>Large learning curve</li>
							<li>How well do you know PHP?</li> <!-- Because Laravel strips out a lot of the weirdness in PHP -->
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							Backwards: Laravel 5.5 only supports PHP 7 </br>
							Learning curve: Easy to get started but what about Facades & wtf is an IoC Container? </br>
							Laravel is magic - which is great until something breaks and you have no idea what's going on because everything is obfuscated</br>
							For example - what's a facade? what's a service container?</br>
							Laravel strips out a lot of the weirdness of PHP - are you a PHP dev or a Laravel dev?

						<h2>More...</h2>
						<ul>

						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							The difference between 5.3 and 5.5 is one year - that's pretty crazy for 3 versions</br>
							Facades are a static interface for integrating classes with Laravel
							Instead of instatinating a class, passing in the dependencies, etc.
							You use a facade and laravel takes care of the whole process for you behind the scenes.</br>
							But Jeffrey Way can describe this stuff a lot better than I can - laracasts</br>

						<h2>How We Use Laravel</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>It runs our main site</li>
							<li>Our CMS</li>
							<li>Our billing API</li>
							<li>Our faculty portal</li>
							<li>And it will continue to be implemented into more projects as the company grows</li>

						<h2>Facing Your Demons</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Upgrade from 4.2 to 5.3</li>
							<li>Implementing API authentication</li>
							<li>Implementing social logins</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							Again, Laravel isn't backwards compatible so the upgrade was a disaster. Almost everything broke</br>
							Authentication without Laravel & everything it provides would have been a nightmare - a secondary package would have been required
							and what are the chances that something like that gets maintained properly?</br>
							Social logins would also require a package and would get unbelievably messy and untameable.</br>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Learning From Your Demons</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Laravel's extensive documentation</li>
							<li>The community</li>
							<li>Laravel Passport & Auth facade</li>
							<li>Laravel Socialite</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							The extensive documentation carefully traced all the steps necessary for the upgrade</br>
							Whatever the documentation lacked - the community helped with - your question has already been answered</br>
							For authentication - Laravel offers two amazing packages (Passport & Socialite)</br>
							Passport - provides a full OAuth2 server implementation for API authentication (announced in 2016 at Laracon)</br>
							Socialite - fluent interface to OAuth authentication with FB, G+, Twitter, more </br>
							Whenever the FB API changes - Socialite changes with you, we no longer have to worry about our social logins breaking with every update.
